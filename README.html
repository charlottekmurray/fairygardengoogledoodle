<p>I want this google doodle to feel very earthy and magical. A big inspiration for it is the little miniature fairy houses and gardens that people will build and collect. While watching it, I want the user to feel like they are in a magical fairy land, surrounded by greenery, cute little mushrooms, and fairies flying all around.</p>
